  abstract = {We present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the evolution of a sparse Hamiltonian H for a given time t in terms of a procedure for computing the matrix entries of H. In particular, when H acts on n qubits, has at most a constant number of nonzero entries in each row/column, and |H| is bounded by a constant, we may select any positive integer \$k\$ such that the simulation requires O((\textbackslash log\^{}*n)t\^{}\{1+1/2k\}) accesses to matrix entries of H. We show that the temporal scaling cannot be significantly improved beyond this, because sublinear time scaling is not possible.},

  abstract = {Quantum many-body physics simulations with matrix product states can often be accelerated if the quantum symmetries present in the system are explicitly taken into account. Conventionally, quantum symmetries have to be determined beforehand when constructing the tensors for the matrix product state algorithm. In this work, we present a matrix product state algorithm with an adaptive U(1) symmetry. This algorithm can take into account or benefit from U(1) or Z2 symmetries when they are present or analyze the nonsymmetric scenario when the symmetries are broken without any external alteration of the code. To give some concrete examples we consider an XYZ model and show the insight that can be gained by (i) searching the ground state and (ii) evolving in time after a symmetry-changing quench. To show the generality of the method, we also consider an interacting bosonic system under the effect of a symmetry-breaking dissipation.},

  abstract = {An algorithm for the simulation of the evolution of slightly entangled quantum states has been recently proposed as a tool to study time-dependent phenomena in one-dimensional quantum systems. Its key feature is a timeevolving block-decimation (TEBD) procedure to identify and dynamically update the relevant, conveniently small subregion of the otherwise exponentially large Hilbert space. Potential applications of the TEBD algorithm are the simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians, transport in quantum systems far from equilibrium and dissipative quantum mechanics. In this paper we translate the TEBD algorithm into the language of matrix product states in order to both highlight and exploit its resemblances to the widely used density-matrix renormalizationgroup (DMRG) algorithms. The TEBD algorithm, being based on updating a matrix product state in time, is very accessible to the DMRG community and it can be enhanced by using well-known DMRG techniques, for instance in the event of good quantum numbers. More importantly, we show how it can be simply incorporated into existing DMRG implementations to produce a remarkably effective and versatile “adaptive time-dependent DMRG” variant, that we also test and compare to previous proposals.},

  abstract = {We review different tensor network approaches to study the spreading of operators in generic nonintegrable quantum systems. As a common ground to all methods, we quantify this spreading by means of the Frobenius norm of the commutator of a spreading operator with a local operator, which is usually referred to as the out of time order correlation (OTOC) function. We compare two approaches based on matrix-product states in the Schr\textbackslash "odinger picture: the time dependent block decimation (TEBD) and the time dependent variational principle (TDVP), as well as TEBD based on matrix-product operators directly in the Heisenberg picture. The results of all methods are compared to numerically exact results using Krylov space exact time evolution. We find that for the Schr\textbackslash "odinger picture the TDVP algorithm performs better than the TEBD algorithm. Moreover the tails of the OTOC are accurately obtained both by TDVP MPS and TEBD MPO. They are in very good agreement with exact results at short times, and appear to be converged in bond dimension even at longer times. However the growth and saturation regimes are not well captured by both methods.},

In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.},

In a recent paper [arXiv:0907.2994v1] we discussed how to incorporate a global internal symmetry, given by a compact, completely reducible group G, into tensor network decompositions and algorithms. Here we specialize to the case of Abelian groups and, for concreteness, to a U(1) symmetry, often associated with particle number conservation. We consider tensor networks made of tensors that are invariant (or covariant) under the symmetry, and explain how to decompose and manipulate such tensors in order to exploit their symmetry. In numerical calculations, the use of U(1) symmetric tensors allows selection of a specific number of particles, ensures the exact preservation of particle number, and significantly reduces computational costs. We illustrate all these points in the context of the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz.},

  abstract = {A general scheme of fractal decomposition of exponential operators is presented in any order m. Namely, exp[x(A+B)]=Sm(x)+O(xm+1) for any positive integer m, where Sm(x)=et1A\hphantom{,}et2B\hphantom{,}et3A\hphantom{,}et4B⋅⋅⋅etMA with finite M depending on m. A general recursive scheme of construction of \{tj\} is given explicitly. It is proven that some of \{tj\} should be negative for m≥3 and for any finite M (nonexistence theorem of positive decomposition). General systematic decomposition criterions based on a new type of time-ordering are also formulated. The decomposition exp[x(A+B)]=[Sm(x/n)]n +O(xm+1/nm) yields a new efficient approach to quantum Monte Carlo simulations.},

  abstract = {We present a scheme to efficiently simulate, with a classical computer, the dynamics of multipartite quantum systems on which the amount of entanglement (or of correlations in the case of mixed-state dynamics) is conveniently restricted. The evolution of a pure state of n qubits can be simulated by using computational resources that grow linearly in n and exponentially in the entanglement. We show that a pure-state quantum computation can only yield an exponential speed-up with respect to classical computations if the entanglement increases with the size n of the computation, and gives a lower bound on the required growth.},
