  abstract = {We present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the evolution of a sparse Hamiltonian H for a given time t in terms of a procedure for computing the matrix entries of H. In particular, when H acts on n qubits, has at most a constant number of nonzero entries in each row/column, and |H| is bounded by a constant, we may select any positive integer \$k\$ such that the simulation requires O((\textbackslash log\^*n)t\^\{1+1/2k\}) accesses to matrix entries of H. We show that the temporal scaling cannot be significantly improved beyond this, because sublinear time scaling is not possible.},

  abstract = {We review different tensor network approaches to study the spreading of operators in generic nonintegrable quantum systems. As a common ground to all methods, we quantify this spreading by means of the Frobenius norm of the commutator of a spreading operator with a local operator, which is usually referred to as the out of time order correlation (OTOC) function. We compare two approaches based on matrix-product states in the Schr\textbackslash "odinger picture: the time dependent block decimation (TEBD) and the time dependent variational principle (TDVP), as well as TEBD based on matrix-product operators directly in the Heisenberg picture. The results of all methods are compared to numerically exact results using Krylov space exact time evolution. We find that for the Schr\textbackslash "odinger picture the TDVP algorithm performs better than the TEBD algorithm. Moreover the tails of the OTOC are accurately obtained both by TDVP MPS and TEBD MPO. They are in very good agreement with exact results at short times, and appear to be converged in bond dimension even at longer times. However the growth and saturation regimes are not well captured by both methods.},

  abstract = {Matrix-product states have become the de facto standard for the representation of one-dimensional quantum many body states. During the last few years, numerous new methods have been introduced to evaluate the time evolution of a matrix-product state. Here, we will review and summarize the recent work on this topic as applied to finite quantum systems. We will explain and compare the different methods available to construct a time-evolved matrix-product state, namely the time-evolving block decimation, the MPO WI,II method, the global Krylov method, the local Krylov method and the one- and two-site time-dependent variational principle. We will also apply these methods to four different representative examples of current problem settings in condensed matter physics.},

  abstract = {The density-matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) has established itself over the last decade as the leading method for the simulation of the statics and dynamics of one-dimensional strongly correlated quantum lattice systems. In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.},

A general recursive scheme of construction of \{tj\} is given explicitly. It is proven that some of \{tj\} should be negative for m≥3 and for any finite M (nonexistence theorem of positive decomposition). General systematic decomposition criterions based on a new type of time-ordering are also formulated. The decomposition exp[x(A+B)]=[Sm(x/n)]n +O(xm+1/nm) yields a new efficient approach to quantum Monte Carlo simulations.},

The evolution of a pure state of n qubits can be simulated by using computational resources that grow linearly in n and exponentially in the entanglement. We show that a pure-state quantum computation can only yield an exponential speed-up with respect to classical computations if the entanglement increases with the size n of the computation, and gives a lower bound on the required growth.},
